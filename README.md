# GoDaddy-Metrics
As a consultant at GoDaddy, we are constantly tracked on a dozen of metrics, including our customer availability (our percentage
of availability on the phone), our sales (new revenue and renewed revenue), our survey scores etc. 
Although they allow us to obtain this data so that we can track our performance, we are not provided any analytical tools so the data is rendered 
meaningless for us agents. We have no way of visualizing our performance.

A few months ago, I started recording this data on a spreadsheet that I would take home and look at. Even though I wasn't provided
with any graph tools, I had no reason to not make some myself, so I got to work with jupyter notebooks. 

Unfortunately after contacting my supervisor, I was told that I could not upload any of my real data so I had to
generate random data so that I could at least present my notebooks to Github, even if the data is meaningless.

After a few hours, I was able to create this following pipeline layout
![Pipeline Flow Chart](https://github.com/jdhouti/GoDaddy-Metrics/blob/master/flowchart.jpg)

The end result is not yet available in `visualize.ipynb` because Github does not allow iframes to render in Jupyter notebooks
yet.
